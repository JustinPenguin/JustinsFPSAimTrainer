# JustinsFPSAimTrainer
An FPS aim trainer is a tool intended to help gamers improve their aim in shooter games.
Compatible with both consoles and computers. Developed in Epic Games' UE4.

This is Unique from any other published aim trainers in that it supports the use of consoles and controllers,
expanding the market for FPS aim trainers to console players, a growing platform due to the popularity of Fortnite.
I originally came up with this idea from playing the game myself at a high level on PC, noticing the lack of this
resource for my console friends.

Features two main modes that each branch into three other styles.
The two main branches features a free play mode and a timed mode. These are exactly what they sound like, a mode where you
can practice your aim without the constraints of time, and the other where you try to perform your best in 60 seconds.
The next three modes this branches off into feature three different game styles.

The first style is the most simplistic, where there are boxes arbitrarily floating in front of the player,
and their goal is to be able to click and destroy as many of them as possible. Once a box is destroyed, another will take its place in another arbitray location.

The second style is similar to the first one, except that the boxes are moving.

The third style is the most unique, where the boxes are moving, but also require that the user hold down the mouse button on them long enough for them to be destroyed. Colors indicate health remaining.

All of these game styles, and both game modes come with three statistics that the user can see. They are the amount of targets destroyed, their accuracy, and the rate at which the targets are being destroyed (targets destroyed/seconds).
In addition to this, at the beginning of the launch of the game, the user is promted their user name. 
With this, the users can visit the high score section, where they can see how their scores stack up to each unique user name that has been inputted for each game mode.

The final feature of this game is that there is an adjustable X and Y sensitivity, also known as how quickly the screen will move in the X and Y direction based on mouse or joystick movement.
This is crucial, since players will already have sensitivities in their favorite games that they are comfortable with and would like to fine tune in this aim trainer.

I hope you guys enjoy!
